Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.

Example:
Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, excluding [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99])

 Count Numbers with Unique Digits


public class Solution {
    public int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        //if n=0 then power of 0 becomes 1
        if(n==0) return 1;
        //if n=1 then power of 1 of that number is the number itself so here is < 10 so 0 to 9 is having 10 options 
        if(n==1) return 10;
        
        int count =10;
        int base =9;
        
        for(int i =0 ; i < n-1 ; i++){
            base = base*(9-i);
            count +=base;
            
        }
        
        return count;
        
    }
}
