 Maximum difference between two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number
Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the difference between any two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number in arr[].

Examples: If array is [2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1] then returned value should be 8 (Diff between 10 and 2). If array is [ 7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2 ] then returned value should be 2 (Diff between 7 and 9)



 
 
 
 int maxDiff (int arr[], int n)
{
    // Initialize diff, current sum and max sum
    int diff = arr[1]-arr[0];
    int curr_sum = diff;
    int max_sum = curr_sum;
 
    for(int i=1; i<n-1; i++)
    {
        // Calculate current diff
        diff = arr[i+1]-arr[i];
 
        // Calculate current sum
        if (curr_sum > 0)
           curr_sum += diff;
        else
           curr_sum = diff;
 
        // Update max sum, if needed
        if (curr_sum > max_sum)
           max_sum = curr_sum;
    }
 
    return max_sum;
}
